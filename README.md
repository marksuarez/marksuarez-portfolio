My personal portfolio site. Built with Astro, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## About

This is where I showcase my front-end development work. Projects are pulled from a Notion database at build time, so I can update my portfolio without touching code.

## Stack

- **Astro** - Static site generator
- **React** + **TypeScript** - Components
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **GSAP** - Animations (ScrollSmoother, ScrollTrigger, SplitText)
- **MixItUp** - Project filtering
- **Alpine.js** - Lightweight interactivity
- **Notion API** - Content management

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

Deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions. Push to `main` or manually trigger a workflow to rebuild with fresh Notion data.
